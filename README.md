# Game Development Incentives

## Project Description
Game Development Incentives is a decentralized platform designed to encourage collaboration and reward contributors in game development projects. It allows project owners to allocate a rewards pool and distribute it among contributors proportionally based on their contributions. The system ensures transparency, security, and fairness in the reward allocation process.

## Project Vision
The primary goal of this project is to create a trustless system that:
- Encourages contributions to game development projects.
- Offers a transparent mechanism to allocate and claim rewards.
- Ensures security and fairness in fund management and distribution.

By leveraging blockchain technology, this project aims to simplify collaboration and incentivize community participation in creative endeavors.

## Key Features
- **Owner-Managed Rewards Pool**: The contract owner can add funds to the rewards pool, ensuring contributors receive compensation for their efforts.
- **Contribution Registration**: Owners can register and track contributions from multiple contributors.
- **Reward Calculation**: A proportional reward system calculates the share of rewards based on a contributor's contribution relative to the total.
- **Reward Claims**: Contributors can claim their rewards in a secure, transparent manner.
- **Funds Withdrawal**: Unused funds in the rewards pool can be safely withdrawn by the project owner.
- **Event Logging**: Key actions such as contributions, claims, and fund additions are logged through events for transparency.

## How It Works
1. **Adding Funds**: The contract owner deposits funds into the rewards pool.
2. **Recording Contributions**: Contributorsâ€™ work is logged with a specified contribution amount.
3. **Claiming Rewards**: Contributors can calculate and claim their share of rewards proportionate to their contributions.
4. **Funds Management**: Any remaining balance can be withdrawn by the owner.
